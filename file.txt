Hello World!!

Today is Thursday the 7th day of November, 2024. Rest in Peace, cousin Linda!  You will be missed, terribly!!

It's also a hot day in New York city this November.  Today it was 80 degrees!  In November!!

Who would EVAH believe that it would be 80 degrees in November in Brooklynn, New York?  Last week it was 42 degrees the entire day for the week!!

Locked out of Citrix.  Have contacted help desk but they are unable to get authorization from manager(I don't remember a "pin" being set , but it was at some point) to unlock me because she hasn't responded to their verification messages from helpdesk to acknowledge me as an employee. I cannot use the "forgot password or reset password" option as it will send me an email to rest and that can only be accessed through Citrix.  I have but all my shifts back for the morning in hopes of resolving this quickly.  Thank you and please know that I appreciate you all for putting up with us. Thank you.
