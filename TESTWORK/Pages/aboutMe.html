      <h2>About ANTWAN</h2>
      <strong>
        <p>
        <p>Hello!! My name is Antwan Grant.</p>
        <p>I'm a Veteran of the United States Marine Corp, mother of 5, and married for 31 years. I am also a 14+ year
          Software developer veteran who is attempting to pivot from backend coding to frontend web design.</p>

        <p>I want to do this because it will allow me to view the work that I am doing upfront rather than
          behind-the-scenes coding and not have any idea if my work is being successfully used or not.</p>

        <p>I love to read, and for all those who believe, I am a Christian and believe in the life, death, burial, and
          resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p>I am also a motorcycle "chick." I love riding with my husband, solo, and with the female motorcycle club that
          I have been a member of for the past 2 years. We have gone to many states including Texas, Alabama, Detroit,
          North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and just recently completed the scariest
          ride of my life (because I do not like riding, driving, or flying over water) to Key West, Florida. Just
          living the life!</p>

        <p>My motorcycle club is called <strong>XFACTORZ Sisterz N Unity</strong>, and we derive out of Ocala, Florida.
          We have sister clubs in Tennessee, Florida, California, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Life has been thrilling!</p>

        <p>I hope to learn to code web pages even better with the completion of this course and maybe even make a few
          friends.</p>

        <p>I reside in Loganville, Georgia. For those of you who live in Atlanta, GA, I'm 45 minutes from there. So,
          let's meet up!!</p>
        </p>
