    <h2>About ANTWAN</h2>
    <p>
      Hello!! My name is Antwan Grant. I'm a Veteran of the United States Marine
      Corp, mother of 5 and married for 31 years. I am also a 14+ year Software
      developer veteran who is attempting to pivoit from backend coding to front
      end web design. I want to do this because it will allow me to view the
      work that i am doing up front rather than behind the scenes coding and not
      have any idea of if my work is being successfully used or not. I love to
      read and for all those who believe, I am a christian and believe in the
      life, death, burial and resurection of Jesus Christ. I am also a
      motorcycle "chick". I love riding with my husband, solo and with the
      female motorcycle club that I have been a member of for the past 2 years.
      We have gone to many states including Texas, Alabama, Detroit, North
      Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,Tennesse, Kentucky, Ohio, and just
      recently completed the scariest ride of my life(because I do not like
      riding, driving or flying over water) to the Key West, Florida. Just
      living the life. My MotorCycle club is called XFACTORZ Sisterz N Unity and
      we derive out of Ocala, Florida. We have sister clubs in Tennessee,
      Florida, California, Texas and Puerto Rico. Life has been thrilling ! I
      hope to learn to code web pages even better with the completion of this
      course and maybe even make a few friends. I reside in Loganville, Georgia.
      For those of you who live in Atlata, Ga, I'm 45 minutes from there. So
      lets meet up!!
