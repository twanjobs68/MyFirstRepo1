    <h2>About ANTWAN</h2>
    <p>Hello!!  My name is Antwan Grant.  I'm a Veteran of the United States Marine Corp, mother of 5 and married for 31 years.  I am also 
        a 14+ year Software developer veteran who is attempting to pivoit from backend coding to front end web design.  I want to do this 
        because it will allow me to view the work that i am doing up front rather than behind the scenes coding and not have any idea of if my
        work is being successfully used or not.  I love to read and for all those who believe, I am a christian and believe in the life, death,
        burial and resurection of Jesus Christ.  I am also a motorcycle "chick". I love riding with my husband, solo and with the female motorcycle
        club that I have been a member of for the past 2 years.  We have gone to many states including Texas, Alabama, Detroit, North Carolina, South Carolina,
        Florida,Tennesse, Kentucky, Ohio, and just recently completed the scariest ride of my life(because I do not like riding, driving or flying over water)
        to the Key West, Florida.  Just living the life.  My MotorCycle club is called XFACTORZ Sisterz N Unity and we derive out of Ocala, Florida. We have
        sister clubs in Tennessee, Florida, California, Texas and Puerto Rico.  Life has been thrilling
        !  I hope to learn to code web pages even better with the completion of this course and maybe even make a few friends.  I reside in Loganville, Georgia.
        For those of you who live in Atlata, Ga, I'm 45 minutes from there.  So lets meet up!!
