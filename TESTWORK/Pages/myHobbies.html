    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      Hello!! My name is Antwan Grant. Just a little stuff about me. First of
      all...I love to read and for all those who believe, I am a christian and
      believe in the life, death, burial and resurection of Jesus Christ. I am
      also a motorcycle "chick". I love riding with my husband, solo and with
      the female motorcycle club that I have been a member of for the past 2
      years. We have gone to many states including Texas, Alabama, Detroit,
      North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,Tennesse, Kentucky, Ohio, and just
      recently completed the scariest ride of my life(because I do not like
      riding, driving or flying over water) to the Key West, Florida. Just
      living the life. My MotorCycle club is called XFACTORZ Sisterz N Unity and
      we derive out of Ocala, Florida. We have sister clubs in Tennessee,
      Florida, California, Texas and Puerto Rico. Life has been thrilling ! I
      hope to learn to code web pages even better with the completion of this
      course and maybe even make a few friends. I reside in Loganville, Georgia.
      For those of you who live in Atlata, Ga, I'm 45 minutes from there. So
      lets meet up!!
