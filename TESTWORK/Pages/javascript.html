        // typeof "Hello"; // Returns "string"
        // typeof true; // Returns "boolean"

        //2. Strings ex- 
        "Hello World"
        'Hello World'

        //4. Undefined
        // when you do not give a variable a value (abscense of value such as a variable with no value)
        // undefined

        //5. null- does the same as undefined but is a little more easier for javascript to work with other languages
        // null //the developer sets a value to null
