        // 5 data Types
        //     Decimal numbers are called floating or Double point numbers)
        //1. /Numbers- whole numbers or Decimals() 32 bit CSSFontFeatureValuesRule(whole number or a decimal number. )
        //  10
        //  3.145159

        //2. Strings ex- 
        "Hello World"
        'Hello World'
        // which is a sequence of text surrounded by double or single quotes

        //3. Booleans - 
        // true
        // false

        //4. Undefined
        // when you do not give a variable a value (abscense of value such as a variable with no value)
        // undefined

        //5. null- does the same as undefined but is a little more easier for javascript to work with other languages
        // null //the developer sets a value to null

        //6. Object - a structure where a number of properties is set inside of it
        // const user={
        user = {
            firstName: "john",
